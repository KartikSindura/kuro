## Description

Wake up your pc with Kuro the cat

### history

My own code for replacing [kuro](https://github.com/KartikSindura/kuro) that it seems to be abandoned.

## Installation

- Download via [the KDE store](https://www.pling.com/p//)
- Install it via the splashscreen plugin ("get new ..." button into System Setting > Colors & Themes > Splash Screen)
- Download the last release and extract it (or clone the repo and copy the `a2n.kuro` folder) and place the folder into `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/`
